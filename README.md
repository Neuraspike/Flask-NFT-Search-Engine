## NFT Search Engine with Python and Flask

# NFT-Search-Engine


In this tutorial, weâ€™ll learn how to transform our command-line based NFT Search Engine from the previous tutorial and turn it into a full-blown web application using Python and Flask.

## Dataset

For this tutorial, we will be utilizing a dataset that I manually scraped from the OpenSeas website (a market place where you could purchase NFTs) by downloading a bunch of NFTs profile picture projects.

The downloaded ones are:

    1) Bored Apes
    2) Cryptopunk, and
    3) Alien Frens

#### USAGE
- git clone https://github.com/Neuraspike/Flask-NFT-Search-Engine

- cd Flask-NFT-Search-Engine

Before running the script, make sure you have all the requirements already installed.
 
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can:

 - Extract features from the database of images: **python extract_features.py --dataset ./static/img/ --index ./static/output/features.csv**
 - Perform the search via localhost:5000: **python app.py**
 - Select an image from the folder directory: static/upload/
